# Spotify Now Playing to Bluesky for ListigePlaylists

This Make.com blueprint automatically shares your currently playing Spotify track to Bluesky, making it easy to contribute to the [@listigeplaylists.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/listigeplaylists.bsky.social) curated playlist!

Perfect for music lovers who want to share their listening habits and contribute to the community playlist without any manual effort.

## What This Does

Every time you play a new track on Spotify, this automation will:
1. Detect your currently playing song
2. Download the album artwork
3. Create a beautiful Bluesky post with:
   - Song title and artist name
   - Album artwork
   - Link to the track on Spotify
   - A mention to @listigeplaylists.bsky.social

## Make.com Free Plan Information

This blueprint works with Make.com's free plan! Here's what you need to know:

- **Free plan gives you:** 1,000 operations per month
- **This scenario uses:** 5 operations per run
- **Maximum runs per month:** 200 runs (1,000 √∑ 5)

## Scheduling Options

You can choose how frequently this automation runs based on your needs and Make.com plan. Here are two common configurations:

### Option 1: Conservative Schedule (Recommended for Free Plan)
**Run every 4 hours**
- **Runs per day:** 6 (24 hours √∑ 4 hours)
- **Runs per month:** ~180 (6 √ó 30 days)
- **Operations used:** ~900 (180 √ó 5)
- **Remaining buffer:** 100 operations

This schedule ensures you stay well within free plan limits while still capturing your listening activity throughout the day. It's also less "spammy" on Bluesky, giving your followers a nice overview of your music taste without overwhelming them.

### Option 2: Frequent Schedule (For More Active Sharing)
**Run every 15 minutes**
- **Runs per day:** 96 (24 hours √ó 60 minutes √∑ 15 minutes)
- **Runs per month:** ~2,880 (96 √ó 30 days)
- **Operations required:** ~14,400 (2,880 √ó 5)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This option would exceed the free plan limits within the first day! To use this schedule, you would need:
- A paid Make.com plan (starting at $9/month for 10,000 operations)
- Or to manually turn the scenario on/off when you want to share music

This schedule captures almost everything you listen to in real-time, making it ideal for heavy music listeners who want to share their activity as it happens.

### Customizing Your Schedule

You can set any schedule that works for you! Here's how to calculate your usage:

**Formula:**
Operations per month = (24 √∑ hours between runs) √ó 30 days √ó 5 operations.

**Example calculations:**
- Every 30 minutes: (24 √∑ 0.5) √ó 30 √ó 5 = 7,200 operations/month
- Every 2 hours: (24 √∑ 2) √ó 30 √ó 5 = 1,800 operations/month
- Every 6 hours: (24 √∑ 6) √ó 30 √ó 5 = 600 operations/month

To stay within the free plan (1,000 operations), the minimum time between runs should be:
Minimum hours = (24 √ó 30 √ó 5) √∑ 1,000 = 3.6 hours

So setting it to run every 4 hours or more will keep you within free limits.
